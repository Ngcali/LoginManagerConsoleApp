# Login Manager Console App

This is a console-based application that provides user registration and login functionality. It consists of two main files: `main.py` and `test_main.py`.

## Running the Tests

To execute the test cases defined in `test_main.py`, use the following command:

python -m unittest test_main.py


This command runs the tests using the `unittest` framework and verifies the correctness of the code in `main.py`. It compares the expected outputs with the actual outputs to ensure the functionality is working as expected.

## Running the Main Program

To run the main program and interact with the application, execute the following command:

python main.py


This command executes the logic in `main.py` and displays a welcome message and options for user registration, login, and exit. You can input your choices and interact with the application accordingly.

Please note that running `main.py` does not execute the test cases defined in `test_main.py`. It focuses on the actual functionality of the application.
